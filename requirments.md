PROJECT NAME:
	Team 404

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
	Social media app marketed to professionals or hobbyists alike, for the purpose of learning.
	Place to share common interests, where people can ask questions, share interests, create posts and make friends.
	Feed personalized to their interests.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
	Most social media apps are cluttered. Users' feeds are flooded with random videos and it can often be disorientating.
	Although some apps are designed with algorithms to prevent this and to show the user what they think they would like,
	they still do not remain loyal to this concept 100% of the time.
	
	Our software is designed to show the user exactly what they want to see, and they can choose when they see it.
	It filters out other topics so the user sees what they choose using tags.
	
SCOPE:
	The product will be avaible on desktop and mobile if time permits. For now, we will start it as a web application. We will limit the number of tags we will have to about 3 to start. We will also limit the size of uploads, so that we can ensure that the server won't slow down or get bogged down by a bunch of heavy data going through at once.

ASSUMPTIONS:
	The app will be used on all if not most devices. Username will be different than display name, with the ability to choose display name. For example, say my real name is John Doe, this would be used as my display name, but then I had a username of johndoe123, which would be displayed as a different name.  

FEATURES:
	Users will be able to select their feed using tags. Tags will be displayed on the side of the screen, so that they will have easy access to it at all times. It will of course include a search bar so that users can search for whatever they are looking for, whether that is in or out of scope of the tag that they are looking at. It will also include a follow system, allowing users to like and follow their friends, and receive follow backs. Lastly (and probably the most obvious feature), it will have to include a secure login that includes two step verification, or an email when someone tries to log in to their account.

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIRMENTS:
    The app/site will have the need for little monitoring. It will require moderators to help keep it safe and ethical. It will also have a good, modern look to it, as well as good documentation such as Terms of Use, and Privacy Policies.
