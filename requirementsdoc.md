Project Name: Max's Music Matcher


Business Context:
Musicians of all types usually have the intention of playing as a hobby (just for fun), or playing live performances for social events. Many of those musicians are unable to connect with other musicians with similar interests, experience, and schedules. The musician should be able to create their profile that matches them with other musicians with the same intentions and goals. 


Problem Statement:
It is difficult and time consuming for musicians to put their names out there. This software is focused on: 1) Reducing the amount of time and effort musicians put into finding others with similar interests and expertise, 2) Providing an easily accessible platform for new upcoming musicians to showcase their music.
The solution will seek to address these problems by allowing musicians to input information about themselves, and allow them to see other similar musicians.
Scope:
The app will be available on any device that has an internet connection.
There will be a filtering algorithm, ability to add photos, share music, match with people, and send messages
